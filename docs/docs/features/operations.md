# Operations

## Operations { .hidden }

Operations are at the core of Huma. They map an HTTP method verb and resource path to a handler function with well-defined inputs and outputs. When looking at an API made up of resources, the operations correspond to the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc methods on those resources like in the example below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Operations
        GET
        GET2[GET]
        POST
        PUT
        DELETE
    end

    API --> Resource1[Resource /items]
    API --> Resource2["Resource /users/{user-id}"]

    Resource1 --> POST
    Resource1 --> GET
    Resource1 --> DELETE
    Resource2 --> GET2
    Resource2 --> PUT
```

Operations are created using the [`huma.Register`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eugenepentland/huma/v2#Register) function:

```go
huma.Register(api, huma.Operation{
	OperationID: "your-operation-name",
	Method:      http.MethodGet,
	Path:        "/path/to/resource/{id}",
	Summary:     "A short description of the operation",
}, func(ctx context.Context, input *YourInput) (*YourOutput, error) {
	// ... Implementation goes here ...
})
```

!!! info "REST"

    If following REST-ish conventions, operation paths should be nouns, and plural if they return more than one item. Good examples: `/notes`, `/likes`, `/users/{user-id}`, `/videos/{video-id}/stats`, etc. Huma does not enforce this or care, so RPC-style paths are also fine to use. Use what works best for you and your team.

!!! info "OperationID"

    Did you know? The `OperationID` is used to generate friendly CLI commands in [Restish](https://rest.sh/) and used when generating SDKs! It should be unique, descriptive, and easy to type.

    ```sh title="Terminal"
    $ restish your-api your-operation-name --param=value ...
    ```

## Handler Function

The operation handler function always has the following generic format, where `Input` and `Output` are custom structs defined by the developer that represent the entirety of the request (path/query/header params & body) and response (headers & body), respectively:

```go title="code.go"
func(context.Context, *Input) (*Output, error)
```

There are many options available for configuring OpenAPI settings for the operation, and custom extensions are supported as well. See the [`huma.Operation`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eugenepentland/huma/v2#Schema) struct for more details.

## Input & Output Models

Inputs and outputs are **always** structs that represent the entirety of the incoming request or outgoing response. This is a deliberate design decision to make it easier to reason about the data flow in your application. It also makes it easier to share code as well as generate documentation and SDKs.

If your operation has no inputs or outputs, you can use a pointer to an empty struct `*struct{}` when registering it.

```go title="code.go"
func(ctx context.Context, input *struct{}) (*struct{}, error) {
    // Successful response example, defaults to HTTP 204 No Content
    return nil, nil
}
```

## Request Flow

A request flowing into the API goes through a number of steps before reaching your operation handler. The following diagram shows the flow of a request through the system, from request inputs like path/query/header parameters and the request body, through validation, the operation handler, and how outputs are sent in the response.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Inputs
        Path
        Query
        Header
        Body
        RawBody
    end

    subgraph Outputs
        Status
        Headers
        OutBody[Body]
    end

    Path --> Validate
    Query --> Validate
    Header --> Validate
    Body --> Unmarshal --> Validate
    Validate --> Resolve --> Operation
    RawBody -->|raw body input| Operation
    Operation --> Transform
    Transform --> Status
    Transform --> Headers
    Transform --> Marshal --> OutBody
    Operation -->|raw body output| OutBody

`Unmarshal`

: Read the raw bytes of the request body (e.g. JSON) into a Go structure.

[`Validate`](./request-validation.md)

: Check constraints on the inputs (e.g. `minimum`, `maxLength`, etc) and report failures.

[`Resolve`](./request-resolvers.md)

: Run custom validation code and report failures.

`Operation`

: Your operation handler function. Business logic goes here. It returns either your response structure or an error.

[`Transform`](./response-transformers.md)

: Modify the structured response data on the fly before marshaling it to bytes.

[`Marshal`](./response-serialization.md)

: Convert the structured response data into bytes (e.g. JSON).
